# Experiment No. 4: Developing-Wireflow-diagram-for-application-using-open-source-software

## Aim:
To develop Wireflow diagram for application using open-source software
## Algorithm/Procedure:
1.	Define Purpose and Goals: Determine the diagram's purpose and goals, focusing on user flows, navigation, and interactions.
2.	Identify User Personas: If applicable, specify user personas for a user-centric approach.
3.	Gather Requirements: Collect project information, including existing designs and functionality requirements.
4.	Select Software: Choose open-source design software, such as Figma, for wireflow creation.
5.	Create a Project: Begin a new project in your chosen software and set up the canvas to match your project's needs.
6.	Wireframe Screens: Develop wireframes for each application screen, focusing on visual structure.
7.	Define	Interactions:	Add	interaction	notes	or	links	to	illustrate navigation and user interactions.
8.	Create User Flows: Connect wireframes to illustrate user journeys, navigation paths, and interactions.
9.	Add	Annotations:	Include	descriptions	to	clarify	elements	and interactions in each wireframe.
10.	Collaborate	and	Share:	Utilize	collaboration	features to gather feedback from team members and stakeholders.
11.	Iterate and Refine: Revise the wireflow diagram based on feedback, ensuring alignment with project goals.
12.	Finalize and Export: Clean up the wireflow diagram and export it to a suitable format for sharing and documentation.
13.	Document the Wireflow: Create a reference guide to explain the wireflow's purpose and key notes for stakeholders and developers.
14.	Maintain Consistency: Keep the wireflow diagram in sync with the application's actual design, updating it as needed.
